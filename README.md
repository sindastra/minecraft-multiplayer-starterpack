# Minecraft Multiplayer Starterpack
A collection of client-side mods for quality-of-life improvements which also work in multiplayer without having to modify the server.

This is mostly a placeholder repository for now, but maybe if people like this pack I might actually do more here.

Please note that each mod has its own license, please consult with each mod for details.
